# UD-Viz : Urban Data Vizualisation

UD-Viz is a JavaScript library based on [iTowns](https://github.com/itowns/itowns), using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [published on the npm package repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ud-viz), allowing to visualize, analyse and interact with urban data.

A tutorial of the game engine can be found [here](./Doc/Devel/LocalGameTutorial.md)

### Pre-requisite
Developing UD-Viz requires some knowledge about [JS](https://github.com/VCityTeam/UD-SV/blob/master/UD-Doc/Devel/ToolJavaScript.md), [node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js), [npm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)) and [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

### Install nodejs and npm

* **Ubuntu**

  * Install and update npm

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install npm    ## Will pull NodeJS
    sudo npm install -g n     
    sudo n latest
    ```

  * References: [how can I update Nodejs](https://askubuntu.com/questions/426750/how-can-i-update-my-nodejs-to-the-latest-version), and [install Ubuntu](http://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/install-nodejs-ubuntu-14-04/#ubuntu-package-manager)

* **Windows**
  
  * Installing from the [installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  * Installing with the [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)

    ```bash
    iex (new-object net.webclient).downstring(‘https://get.scoop.sh’)
    scoop install nodejs
    ```

### Installing the UD-Viz library per se

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VCityTeam/UD-Viz.git
cd UD-Viz
npm install
```

### Try examples 

```bash
cd PATH_TO_UD-Viz
npm run build
cd /
git clone https://github.com/VCityTeam/UD-SimpleServer
cd UD-SimpleServer
npm install
node index.js PATH_TO_UD-Viz 8000
```

* [UD-Viz-Template](https://github.com/VCityTeam/UD-Viz-Template) (demonstration) application,
* online demos are [available here](https://projet.liris.cnrs.fr/vcity/demos/)

## Developers

### Recommended IDE

Installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended, in order to use the plugin formatter [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode). Once installed you should setup Prettier with single quote coding style (Preferences => Settings => Type in search bar : Single quote => Toggle single quote of Prettier extension)

### Workflow

Before pushing your modifications to the origin repository please run:

```bash
npm run travis
```

in order to assert that `eslint` and `webpack` commands are still effective

**Tip for Windows developers:** eslint requires Linux style newline characters which are often overwritten in Windows environments. Although this is automatically resolved by Git when pushing code, eslint may detect "incorrect" newline characters when running locally. To attempt to fix this you may need to run `npm run eslint -- --fix`.

## Sources directory layout (organizational principles)
Definitions:
 - [Component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering)<a name="anchor-ud-viz-component-definition"></a>
   - `Components` folder: a set of components
 - Extension: a component depending on a [web service](https://github.com/VCityTeam/UD-Viz/blob/master/src/Widgets/Extensions/Geocoding/services/GeocodingService.js#L2) in order to be functionnal.
 - [web widgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_widget)
 - [Templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern)
 - [itowns views](https://www.itowns-project.org/itowns/docs/#api/View/View)

Notes:
 * The position of a specific component in the sub-folder hierarchy reflects
   how it is shared/re-used by sub-directories. For example if a given component 
   is only used by a single widget, then it gets defined within that widget 
   folder. But when another component usage is shared by two widgets then 
   its definition directory gets promoted at the level of the two widgets
   ```

# Temporal Module 

The temporal module manages the interaction to switch time in the scene and
the display of city objects (e.g. buildings) states based on the chosen time. 
These display states are computed from information about the temporal evolution
of city objects stored in a 3DTILES_temporal extension of 3D Tiles.

## 3D Tiles temporal extension 

* The JSON schemas of the extension are stored in [here](../Model/jsonSchemas/). They
  are also openly available [online](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3596881).

* A dataset of the city of Lyon between 2009 and 2015 is also openly
 [available online](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3596861) 

* More information about the extension can be found in the following article:

Jaillot, Vincent, Sylvie Servigne, and Gilles Gesquière. “Delivering
Time-Evolving 3D City Models for Web Visualization.” International Journal of
Geographical Information Science 34, no. 10 (October 2, 2020): 2030–52.

* In short, this extension allows to add dates of existence to city objects as
  well as changing states called transactions (creation, modification,
  demolition, union, division or a composition of these transactions). One can
  also describe versions of the city (an aggregation of city objects for a given
  period of time) and version transitions (transitions between versions and also
  an aggregation of transactions between two versions).

## Design of the temporal module

The entrypoint of the temporal module is [TemporalModule.js](../TemporalModule.js).

The module is designed following the MVVM pattern which is one of the preffered
patterns to design UD-Viz modules (see [UD-Viz architecture notes](../../../../Doc/Devel/ArchitectureMVCTargetDesign.md)).

### The model

The entrypoint of the model is[3DTemporalExtension](../Model/3DTemporalExtension.js). 
The other classes of the model parse the content of the 3DTILES_temporal
extensions pieces scattered in the 3D Tiles classes (e.g. in the bounding
volume or in the batch table).

### The view model

[TemporalProvider.js](../ViewModel/TemporalProvider.js) holds the view model of
this module. It maintains a structure describing city objects display states:
whether they should be displayed or not depending on the date and if yes
with which style: e.g. color, opacity, etc. The style is for instance useful to
hide city objects that should not be displayed or to distinguish existing city
objects from city objects under transactions (e.g. being created or modified).

To associate a style to a specific transaction, just declare it in the
`initCOStyles()` method of the provider. For instance, demolitions are
associated with the red color and with an opacity of 0.6:

````
this.tilesManager.registerStyle('demolition', new CityObjectStyle({
        materialProps: { opacity: 0.6, color: 0xff0000 } })); // red
````

Note that this could be declared in a configuration file to improve usage of this module.

The temporal provider also manages updates of the model.

### The view

The entrypoint of the view is [TemporalView.js](../View/TemporalView.js).
It declares the windows and associates events between windows and the view model.

The view is composed of two windows: the `SLIDERWINDOW` and the `GRAPHWINDOW`.

The slider window allows to move between years:

![](./sliderwindow.png)

The graph window allows to move between versions and through version transitions
parsed from the 3D Tiles temporal extension:

![](./graphwindow.png)

On this figure, circles represents versions and arrows version transitions.
Versions in green represent realized versions while the ones in yellow are
just projects.

Currently one has to choose between one of these windows but we could imagine
using both in the same demo in the future. See the[configuration](#configuration)
section bellow.

## Configuration 

Several options of the temporal module can be specified:

* **view**: enum (see ./View/EnumWindow.js), one of `SLIDERWINDOW` or `GRAPHWINDOW`. 

 The graph window asks for specific configuration, see 
[Graph window specific configuration section bellow](#graph-window-specific-configuration).

* **minTime**: integer, minimum possible display date

* **maxTime**: integer, maximum possible display date 

* **currentTime**: integer, the display date when openning the demo

* **timeStep**: integer, the step in years between two dates
  
For an example of configuration, see the `temporalModule` object in the
`generalDemoConfig.json` file:

  "temporalModule": {
    "view": "SLIDERWINDOW",
    "minTime": 2009,
    "maxTime": 2015,
    "currentTime": 2009,
    "timeStep": 1
  },

### Graph window specific configuration
To use the temporal module with the graph view. 
You need to specify some graphics options.

Inside the file `UDV-Core\examples\data\config\generalDemoConfig.json` 
we add a new field : temporalGraphWindow. 
In there you will find information related to the temporal 
graph window.
```
{
    "type": "class",
    ...,
    "temporalGraphWindow": {
        "graphOption":{ ... }
    }
}
```
Inside the `graphOption`, will be specified all options related to viz.js.
It gives the opportunity to customise the graphs, its color, its structure...
There are many possibilities. It's directly coming from [viz.js](https://almende.github.io/vis/docs/network/).
So, you can fill it with the same options as for viz.js.  
**All documentation about the fields inside `graphOption` can be found in this [doc](https://almende.github.io/vis/docs/network/).**

## Usage and demos

City objects can be in static states (displayed in grey) or in changing states
(transactions). For visual clarity, the current demos displays the following transactions:
*creations*, *modifications* and *demolitions*. However, the module allows to
add styles to other transactions (see [view model design section](#the-view-model) 
for more information). 

Our proposition is to represent city objects' known states in a reference color
(light gray in this example) and to showcase transactions between these states.
Generally, transactions span for a certain amount of time and we do not have
access to the geometry of the feature(s) concerned by the transaction during
this amount of time. Therefore, we propose the following display rule for
transactions: during the first half of the transaction, the geometry of the
**previous** *known state* is displayed. During the second half of a
transaction, the geometry of the **following** *known state* is displayed. The
type of transaction (*creation*, *modification*, etc.) determines the color in
which the geometry is displayed. *Creations* are in green, *modifications* are
in yellow and *demolitions* are in red.  Finally, the opacity varies during the
time of the transaction in the way that it is equal to 1 at the beginning and at
the end of the transaction and to 0 at the half duration of the transaction.
Between these timestamps, it decreases on the first half of the transaction
(from 1 to 0) and increases during the second half of the transaction (from 0 to
1). The following figure illustrates this proposition
on three types of transactions.
